* I graduated with a computer science banchelor degree, GPA = 3.3/4.0.
* Starting from my internship, I have been refactoring and developing a web tool helps editors to edit Japanese-Vietnamese bilingual sentences or words. Thanks to this tool, editors work very efficiently. Moreover, I corporate with other students who are in the role of editors to enhance the tool. I also extracted meaningful information of projects by using it. Afterward, I analyze the data using google spreadsheets to decide what have to do next to improve the working performance. The more details about the tool are in the following links.
