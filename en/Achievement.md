#### 2018-2020
* I graduated with a distinction Computer Science Bachelor degree, GPA = 3.31/4.0, from The University of Engineering and Technology - Vietnam National University (UET - VNU).
* My thesis focuses on identifying Vietnamese antonymous word-pairs from other semantic relations. I used many statistical machine learning techniques and conducted a lot of researches in previously well-known relevant papers. 
    * [*Link to thesis report*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PT8kAXZ1uPSEA3Tmh38V5i0E-Z30ZfW8/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} 

* Starting from my internship, I have been refactoring and developing a web tool helps editors to edit Japanese-Vietnamese bilingual sentences or words. Thanks to this tool, editors work very efficiently. Moreover, I corporate with other students who are in the role of editors to enhance the tool. I also extracted meaningful information of projects by using it. Afterward, I analyze the data using google spreadsheets to improve the working performance. The more details about the tool are in the following links.

<!-- * I am joining a Big Data class. -->
* In the Natural Language Processing team in UET-VNU, I got the following achievements. 
    * Contribute to build the introduction website for the research team NLP-UET-VNU.  
      [*Link to introduction NLP-UET-VNU research team site*](https://uetnlp.github.io/en/Introduction/){:target="_blank"} 
    * Support the team to crawl and preprocess data from websites for building Vietnamese-Japanese bilingual datasets.
    * Build a website using Flask framework with Python programming. It is used a translation server in NLP-UET-VNU team to translate sentences and translate documents focusing on the language pair Vietnamese-Japanese and support Vietnamese-English.

    * Highly contribute to build an extension to translate a page from English to Vietnamese and add Vietnamese subtitles to teaching videos in [Coursera page](https://www.coursera.org/){:target="_blank"} . It is used a translation server in NLP-UET-VNU team. I use javascript/html/css on the client-side and python-Flask on the server-side. 
    * I am one of the authors of the following papers. 
        * Study and experiment previous well-known publications to make valuable comparisons which highlight improvements for paper *Antonyms-Synonyms Discrimination Based On Exploiting Rich Vietnamese Features* published in *2019 16th International Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics (PACLING 2019)*.
        * Build quality datasets that play a very important role in experimenting different approaches for paper *An Effective Coverage Approach for Attention-based Neural Machine Translation* published in *2019 6th NAFOSTED Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS 2019)*.
        * Conduct research on previous popular publications to find out ideas for paper *Cross-lingual Semantic Similarity via Cross-Lingual Embeddings* published in *2018 11th Fundamental and Applied IT Research Conference (Fair 2018)*.
        
    * Support technical aspects for editors from University of Languages & International Studies (ULIS-VNU) and University of Engineering and Technology (UET-VNU) to create Vietnamese-Japanese bilingual datasets by using a Web-based application I developed.
    * Support to write technical reports for a project invested by The Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam and in charge by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Phuong Thai.
    * Attend the seminars discussing on deep learning and the lastest problems in NLP in NLP-UET-VNU team.
    * Attend paper representations in International Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics (PACLING 2019). 
    
* I completed a course during 40 hours about blockchain Tezos with a certificate.
